# 1.0.5 (Up comming updates).

* Gonna make an example in .js so there will be one for .tsx and .js.


# 1.0.4

* Created component HighlightPopup with styling and have a props `onDelete`, to allow users to pass a callback function for deleting highlights. 
* Modified the `Highlight` component to remove the display of emojis/values for radio buttons. The component now provides a cleaner representation of highlights.
* Added ability to search.


# 1.0.3

* Updated the "Tip" component to allow customization of the emoji list. You can now set your own list of emojis, but I've retained a default set for convenience. Additionally, I've introduced a select/option feature alongside the existing radio buttons.


# 1.0.2

* Made so the zoom/scale work.
